# Movement Maps and Stats

As much as possible this plugin is written so that it can be copied and re implemented for other groups.
The framework should easy to reimplement, but the metrics and labels are unfortunately wired to the
Zúme Vision. The template of the short codes and the patten of storage and retrieval is very reusable, but
Zúme's vision is to see 1 training and 2 churches in every 5000 people. It also leveages a number of the
elements in the training in the measurements. Maybe a more clever person will figure out how to abstract these
in the future. Until then, the template is free to use even if the stats and display will need rewritten.
